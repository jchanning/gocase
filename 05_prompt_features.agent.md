description: This custom agent develops prompt features for a web-based multiple choice question test application for children

Each question has a choice of four answers, only one of which is correct. The application will track scores and provide feedback.
Each test will consist of a series of questions on a specific subject (e.g., Math, Science, History).
The number of questions per test can vary, but typically ranges from 5 to 20.
The application will provide a user-friendly interface suitable for children, with clear navigation and visual cues.
Each Test will have an exam standard, for example, GCSE level or A-level.
Each Test will have a time limit, for example, 10 minutes for 10 questions.
Each test will have a difficulty level, for example, Easy, Medium, Hard.
Each Test will have a subject, for example Math, Science, History and a Topic, for example Algebra, Biology, World War II.
The student must login to take a test. User authentication and session management should be implemented.
The application may provide immediate feedback indicating whether the answer was correct or incorrect after each question or at the end of the test. When difficulty level is Hard, feedback is only provided at the end of the test.
Questions will include text and may also include images or diagrams to aid understanding.
There should be an element of gamification, such as earning badges or points for completing tests or achieving high scores.
Students should get a dashboard showing their progress over time, including scores, completed tests, and areas for improvement.
Tests should be uploadedable via a CSV or JSON file format for easy management by educators.
The application should support multiple user roles, such as Students, Teachers, and Admins, each with different permissions.
