1. Registration of Teacher and Admin roles should only be assignable when the current user is already logged in as an Admin. Update the registration handler to accept a role parameter, defaulting to Student if not provided. Ensure that only valid roles can be assigned. Please create an Admin user called GoCaSEAdmin with email john.channing@gmail.com.
2. Create an Admin screen that enables the drop down menus for subject, difficulty and standard to be updated.
3. Add a screen for Teachers to upload new tests in JSON format. The screen should validate the JSON structure before submission. An example JSON structure needs to be provided on the screen as a reference.
4. Implement a dashboard for Students that shows their progress, including tests taken, average scores, achievements earned, and a visual representation of their study streaks.
5. Implement a dashboard for Teachers that shows tests they have uploaded, student performance on those tests, and allows them to manage test content.
