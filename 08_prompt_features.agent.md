On the Admin page, tests can be created by uploading a JSON file. I also need a wizard interface to create tests manually. It should be possible to select the wizard from the Admin page. The wizard should guide the user through entering the test details step by step, including test title, subject, difficulty, time limit, passing score, and questions with possible answers and correct answer designation.2. Implement validation to ensure that the test data is correctly formatted before saving it to the database.
It should be possible to delete existing tests.
The filters on the Available Tests page should include Subject, Difficulty, Standard, and Published status (Published/Unpublished). When a filter is selected, only tests matching the selected criteria should be displayed. PLease ensure this feature has unit test to confirm it works correctly.
When a test has been taken the result should be stored in the database including the student ID, test ID, score, date taken, and time taken. This data should be used to generate reports on student performance over time.
A History page should be added to show all the tests that have been taken by students. The page should include filters for student name, test name, date range, and score range. Each entry should show the student name, test name, score, date taken, and time taken.
A student should seen on the tests they have taken. A Teacher should be able to see all tests taken by all students. An Admin should be able to see all tests taken by all students.
