Each test will have a document of notes that the student should read before taking the test. The notes document may include text, images, and diagrams to aid understanding. 
The notes should be easily accessible from the test interface with a view notes link. 
The documents will be PDFs or PowerPoint files uploaded by the Teacher or Admin when creating the test. 
The creation of a test needs to be modified to include uploading a document with notes.
It must be possible to edit an existing test to attach notes.
A notes document should be added by drag and drop.
The document type checking should ensure only PDF or PowerPoint files are accepted.
When a student views the Available Tests page, there should be an indicator showing whether notes are available for each test. 
Students are not allowed to download the notes. They should only be able to view the notes within the application before starting the test.
The Admin Dashboard should allow tests to be edited and for Notes documents to be added or removed.
